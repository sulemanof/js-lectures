### Common requirements for all of apps:
- create a github repo with the name of chosen app;
- implement an app locally, make commits on every feature you do (commit names should describe your action `add button component`, `create app store` and so on), push it to the origin, add me as reviewer at least 2 days before diploma presentaton;
- the mark will be `60` max if you use:
    + true git flow;
    + ES6 syntax;

    Additional points:
    + use React - `10` points max (in case of using `create-react-app`);
    + use Webpack 4 for bundling your project - `10` points max (do not use `create-react-app`);
    + use Redux for storing your data - `10` points max;
    + use React-Router for routing in your app - `10` points max;

In case of using all of the features we learned at the course the top mark is `100` points;
### Good luck 🤞

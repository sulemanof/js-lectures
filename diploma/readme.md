- [Todo App](./todo.md) ✅
- [Movie App](./movies.md) 🎬

### Common requirements for all of apps:

- create a github repo with the name of chosen app;
- implement an app locally, make commits on every feature you do (commit names should describe your action `add button component`, `create app store` and so on), push it to the origin, add me as reviewer at least 2 days before diploma presentaton;
- the mark will be `60` max if you use:
  - true git flow;
  - ES6 syntax;
  ***
  Additional points:
  - use React - `10` points max (in case of using `create-react-app`);
  - use Webpack 4 for bundling your project - `10` points max (do not use `create-react-app`);
  - use Redux for storing your data - `10` points max;
  - use React-Router for routing in your app - `10` points max;

In case of using all of the features we learned at the course the top mark is `100` points;

### Good luck 🤞
